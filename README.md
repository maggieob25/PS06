# PS06

I spent about 12-15 hours this week on this project, but I also really enjoyed doing this one.

User documentation:
- I got my data from Kaggle - Baseball statistics.  Specifically, I pulled Salary.csv to refine my project.  
- My data had 25576 different observations and 5 different variables.  I used yearID, teamID, and salary the most.
- The widgets I used were drop-down select (table), radio buttons (plot), sliders (plot), and action button (summary)
- The panel for Table tab reports average salary based on three factors
- The panel for Plot tab allows the user to select what year and team the graph should report
- Visual aesthetics for the Plot tab - 6 different colors to choose from!
- The Plot tab also reacts to the widget because the text under the graph changes based on what year the slider is on and what team is selected.
- The panel for Summary tab has a picture of the MLB logo (STOCK IMAGE!) with a link to how the three-letter codes correspond with teams
- The Summary tab also shows a random sample of 5 lines of data and a graph of mean salary from 1985-2015.
